The gardener’s yard seemed to pull off a harmony only the most practiced orchestra could muster; in the back, a group of daffodils, trumpets with their beautiful bronze yellows. The clarinet section would be the lovely blue bells in the shade of the old willow. The lavender, perfectly emulating quiet flutes. And the rising crescendo of roses that seemed absolutely befitting to bask in the sun where everyone could see them.

The yard was often the talk of quiet envy among the neighbors. Surely these colors could only be the result of some form of trickery. Some new sprinklers? Special lights? GMO’s? Passer-bys would argue about the method of care with great thought. It was hard not to, as the lawn never seemed to require tending. The gardener, it appeared, would never leave his house to look after the plants. It had to be sometime in the night’s embrace. One individual had even ran up to the roses to feel them, certainly expecting the texture of plastic under their fingers. Only assurance that the flowers were indeed very real — and with thorns — awaited them. That, and the stern eye of the gardener from his window.

The plant-enthusiast was a man in his late fifties, new to the neighborhood. He rarely went out, only in strange hours, and kept to himself. It seemed he wasn’t concerned with building any relationships with his fellows. 

Of course, this led the neighbors to gossip. The only thing they really knew was that he invited quite a few people, usually one at a time, to his house. Not regularly, but he did have guests. No one would really return again to the place. Was he that repulsive as to drive them away? It seemed the gardener was very lonely. The few that understood knew the truth, or at least part of it: the man’s wife had disappeared soon after moving in. Rumors told of a scandal, then her moving very far away. 

After the incident, the man turned gardener. First, a pad of daisies, white like an old woman’s hair. Weeks later, bluebells of a soft azure, almost matching a familiar eye color. The garden resembled a person in some ways, but not bound only by one individual. A row of daffodils like a youth’s hair. Carnations in every shade of skin. The lawn grew slowly, new additions being added irregularly.

No one ever learned the secret of the gardener’s yard. Most accepted the unnaturally vibrant colors as some form of luck. In a way, it was fate’s forgiveness to a lonely man who had lost his wife. Whatever the method, the HOA was certainly pleased with how nice it made the neighborhood look.
