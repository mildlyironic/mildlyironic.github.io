For my creative writing class, I had to write the prompt: "Describe a restaurant as seen by a person who is waiting for their blind date. Do not mention the date". For this assignment, we were supposed to be as descriptive as possible.



The smell greeted me first; an aroma of seared chicken, sauteed vegetables, and fry sauce. Was that cannelloni my experienced sniffer detected? Of course, and served with a side of… tomato bisque… caesar salad…lettuce was recently frozen, not fresh… pasta is gluten free, interesting. I rubbed my temples in the strained effort that was detecting restaurant entrees from three blocks down the street. Would anyone find that impressive? I let myself hope in the spirit of tonight’s special occasion.

Rounding the street corner, I could see the building in all its two-and-a-half-star glory. It was nestled comfortably between an ice cream parlor and a crafts store. Very idyllic, I thought. A lone shopping cart roamed the parking lot, pushed by some unseen force. Its rusted wheels creaked softly with each rotation. Few cars were here on a Wednesday night, and with the cold of winter, the ice cream parlor was empty. My cheeks were already starting to turn red, the winter air freezing my nostrils. I was careful not to slip on the thin coating of ice along the lot, evidence from last week’s rain.

The building’s exterior was covered in brickwork. Some designs appeared to be haphazardly inserted. Lighter patches formed uncut diamonds on the wall. The restaurant itself, however, was an exception. I, having incredible ocularly senses, could distinguish the subtle difference of the brick. Clearly, these were the work of an experienced craftsman. While to the unattuned eye, these were just mere bricks, identical to the ones beside it, I recognized them for their true form. I rubbed my hand across its side. Rough hewn… a limestone based concrete… made in Canada… individual stone mined from a nearby query, hmmm, likely six to eight miles away from assembly... industrial oven baked, yes. The common saying, “the bricks are browner on the other side,” held true for this building. Was that a common saying?

My eyes shifted to further study this masterwork of a creation. Adorned on its front door were a series of stickers from travel websites and their respective ratings. Ratings that seemed much higher than what I last read online. What a quickly improving restaurant! My mood brightened even further, to my delight, as I realized what an incredible experience tonight would be, dining in a four-star restaurant! And I knew I wouldn’t be alone.

It was my own personal Statue of Liberty, I thought, and I an immigrant. I wasn’t sure, however, that the weight I had gained would qualify me as a “huddled mass”. That would certainly be a more welcome insult than others I’ve heard.

My pace quickened with excitement as I entered through the building’s door. This must be what the gates of heaven are like! My own mortal eyes limited my perception of this godly realm, but the details I found were astounding. On the wall, a plaque proudly presented to me the restaurant’s food safety review. Proudly, in the far back of the room and obscured partially by a  curtain: “Okay”, it proclaimed, with a figure of a man slightly smiling below it. But look at his eyes, see the absolute joy in them! He clearly achieved Nirvana while dining here.

Warm light from overhead lamps bathed the room in a pleasant glow. It was eternally dawn in this place of peace. Would I find my own new beginnings here? Cool air met me from above. There, a fan spun lazily. Despite its lack of speed, it threatened to fall down at any moment, it’s creaking growing louder. Using my increased sense of perception and infereing ability, I could tell that this was placed here to remind us of our own mortality, as we would soon forget it after dining. Haha, clever me, once again. 

Maybe I should touch, I thought. Just to see what it feels like?

“Sir,” a small part of me heard, the noise from the hostess. She, like the restaurant waiting room, smelled like cigarettes. “Sir? Pssst, Mark, come look at this guy. Do you think he’s alright? He’s got this weird, faraway look in his eyes. And look how close he is to the fan blades! Maybe we should call the —”

“I am delightful!” I boomed out, letting the entire restaurant, the whole world know of my status. Several heads turned towards me. All six patrons in the building, surrounded on each side by an ocean of empty chairs and tables, looked at me. I squinted at the hostess’s name tag. “Susan,” I added.

“Err, right,” the hostess, Susan, replied. She gripped something in her purse tighter. “Table for one th—”

“Has anyone else checked in here before me, under my reservation?” I interrupted her once again with my query of utmost importance. “I am quite popular, I will add.”

“Sir, this is is an—” The falling, then shattering, of plates and a curse momentarily silenced her. “We don’t do reservations here.” She gestured towards the myriad of empty tables.

“Well, of course you do, who else did I pay my $50 to, if not to this fine establishment?” I asked. The hostess looked even more disoriented. Her knuckles turned whiter, her hand tightening around something unseen to me in her purse. Working in such a place as this must be so confusing, to be in constant euphoria for hours on end. I gained enough composure for both of us. “Table for two, then, please.”

“Of - of course,” Susan replied. She eyed the waiter behind her, uncertain. Then, she stood up, moved some cylindrical object from her purse to her pocket, and led me towards the back. I caught a quick glimpse of the object’s label: Extra Strength Pepper Spray.

Moving through the restaurant, I thought of maps from the Old World. The way cartographers could misinterpret the continents into rounded, blobby masses of land. Many times, completely omitting certain parts of the world. This was similar to the restaurant, I thought. In our own mortal interpretation of the divine, we associate it with pearly whites, and unbelievable light. Clouds come to mind. But here, was the truth of it. It was grimy. It had dirt, on the walls. I thought I heard scuttering. But these were all just things misaligned from their true meaning. In these perfect proportions, in these perfect settings, these mis-fit characteristics formed the total bliss I saw here.

“Here we are, then,” Susan halted, I was caught off guard by our sudden stop. My table was positioned directly in front of the bathroom. The booth was fixed on the ground, same as the table. Loose stuffing exited the cushions, spilling out onto the floor. The silverware was fixed onto the table like pens at the bank; a thin coord ensured that no patrons took a souvenir home with them. Well, there went a part of my plans for the night. I wondered if I could ask the chef for a fork. I’d settle for a soup spoon, even.

“Uh, thank you,” I said. I eyed the other tables around me. Many were in a similar predicament, with cushions teared, and silverware fixed. But none of the empty tables, truly an ocean of them, were near the bathroom. And none had only a seat for just one. “I need another spot. A table for two, yeah?”

Susan looked looked around at the lack of patrons and abundance of seats. “Sorry,” she said, drawing out the word, “but we have so many reservations, it’s very busy. All of those tables will soon be occupied.”

“Righ, so then you do have reservations here,” I asked. Susan looked behind her.

“Erm… Yes.” She placed a menu on the table and bolted away. The service here was questionable, but fair, I thought. I moved to pull the seat away from the table, but forgot it was fixed in place. I awkwardly shuffled myself into place, and began to study the menu.

What to choose, what to choose? Should I pick something big, to share, or get my own meal? I settled on the latter, and began looking at the entrees. The menu was a laminated sheet of paper, full portions on the front, and the kid’s menu on the back. Both seemed equally ripe with options to pick from.

Illustrations of famous locations in America covered both sides. The Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore, El Capitan. On the back side were a series of tic-tac-toe games, mazes, and coloring pictures. If anyone were below the age of obtaining sentience, it might’ve been fun. I could see trace remains of previous drawings on the back. The menu, being laminated and reusable, didn’t take these coloring attempts well.

When the waiter came over to make my order, I couldn’t pick just one. All of these meals deserved to be sampled multiple times, but I would have to abandon this duty for another time. Another time. My heart started beating faster just thinking of it. I settled on an appetizer to tide me over until later tonight. I eyed the clock in the back of the room.

9:23… 9:23! I realized. That means that I was here for eighty-some minutes! That couldn’t be right. I didn’t notice the other patrons leave beneath the blanket of my inattentiveness. But with my heightened ocular senses and perceptiveness, I knew that to be wrong. “Waiter?” I called. “Waiter!” My voice betrayed me, letting out a sense of worry and urgency I didn’t know that I had. My server turned back towards me. 

“I think your clock is broken. It says its past nine, but that of course, is wrong.” He held out his watch to me to show me the time. The same, dreaded time. Stay calm, I told myself, I’ll just check my phone, too— 9:24! I was waiting for that long! I waved the waiter away with a flash of my hand, and moved to the window. I looked outside. Had there been a car accident? A snow storm? The parking lot greeted me, identical to how it looked before.

Well, no, not identical. It was dirty, incredibly so. Were those leaves I saw? In a parking lot! And over there, a shopping cart full of trash. A single receipt, one receipt too many, filled it.

I hadn’t noticed anything wrong before in the building, but now everything was apparent to me. I was Dorothy, taking off my emerald-covered glasses for the first time. The paper-thin guise of heaven, bliss, Nirvana, everything I saw it to be before fell around me. The only catalyst needed was a lack of hope. Truly, this building was the lowest level of Dante’s inferno. What did I do to ever deserve this? I became acutely aware of a baby crying somewhere. Or was that the fan? I settled on the baby cry, it had to be.

I turned my head to the other diners. How could they be so blind to the horrors all around them! No, don’t eat that! I wanted to cry out to the one nearest to me. But my lips wouldn’t obey. He put a forkful of cannelloni in his mouth. While I couldn’t see anything wrong with it, I knew there had to be something horrible lurking below all that cheese.

I starting breathing hard, faster. My doctor wouldn’t be pleased to see me now. I grabbed my heart. I felt the vibrations of a highway.

“Hello?” A voice beckoned me back to reality, but I did not want to return. I had to get out. Was there no oxygen here? I stumbled onto a nearby table. It was unmoved by my fall. The  tables here in heaven are so strong that— I stopped myself. I was done making excuses for this place. 

I did my best to shout for help, but my words were muddled by my terror. A scream was the best I managed. I needed to get out, now. I struggled to move my arms. I wanted to do so, but I just couldn’t. I was seeing everything in slow motion, and my body would not cooperate.

I looked down at the table and willed my arms to move to the base. I instantly regretted wrapping my hands around it. My fingers brushed against a layer of dust and food residue. But this wouldn’t be enough to stop my willpower. I started to lift, using all of my strength to pull the table free from the ground. Aided by adrenaline, I thought it would be easy. But I was wrong, just like I was wrong about tonight.

I could see Susan far away from me. She started to run. Destination: me. Pepper spray status: raised. It seemed as if the air was full of syrup as I began to run the opposite direction, out the door. I lost a significant portion of my head start, but was able to exit in time.

The doorway served as a portal out of my own personal hell, a mall front restaurant adorned with an Applebees logo disappearing behind me as I ran. I saw now the reason for it’s low ratings, ratings that would go even lower once I returned home. If only I had brought my car with me, I could move away faster. I wondered how much it would cost to move to Antarctica. Anything to get as far away from here as possible.

Seeing the worst disappear behind me, I let out a whoop of joy. If I ever returned to this place again, I would do so with a tank of kerosene and a lighter. While I doubt the motley bricks would burn, the fire would do good for the building’s interior. I pumped my fist in the air with glee. I had escaped! My incredible, heightened physique carried me through the parking lot. I was a survivor, a — I slipped, fast and hard, on the parking lot ice.

It was fate that angled my face towards the building on last time. Somewhere, there was some divine being laughing at me. I could see the building in all its two-and-a-half star lowliness. Warm light pooled through the windows, threatening to corrupt even more of the world than the restaurant’s interior. The street-side windows offered a modest view of the outside parking lot and highway. The sign above, Applebees, brazenly invited the world to eat. It was a pale yellow accented by red. Of course, the only thing not in a total state of disrepair was the sign.

I remembered the door itself creaking as I exited. It’s glass could easily be mistaken for the tan-colored brick on the side, being so dirty. I saw a smudge, it was there! And that smell, too, that awful smell. It was of fry-sauce and grease, of pestilence and rot. I couldn’t imagine what it would be like during the heat of the summer. I pitied the man eating pasta inside. 

When I finally regained the strength to right myself up, I resumed running. I vowed to never go here again. Through the haze of what felt like years, I could still remember enjoying myself at first. How wrong I was.
