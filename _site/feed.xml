I eyed my meal hungrily. A grand turkey avocado sandwich awaited me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Thanks, you too-“ I muttered, then grabbed my mouth. The restaurant immediately quieted as I realized my mistake. But it was too late. The words that would prove my social undoing were already uttered. I grasped for air desperately, trying to recover from my disastrous failure. To all the restaurant’s inhabitants — made by fate spectators to my misfortune — it might’ve looked like I was trying to inhale my sent out words, to take them back somehow. Oh, how I wish I could!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waitress to whom I directed my mispeech towards immediately turned to vomit. Her disgust was made palpable in the hurled up spaghetti on floor; at least, what once was spaghetti. Other patrons had similar reactions. I knew that I had sacrificed my right to blame them when I had made my error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eternally, I will remember the moment, the source of my terrible insomnia today. It took twelve psychologists, two firemen, and the Air-Force’s best men to undo the actions of that night. Everything except for the terrible emotional scars disappeared under government classified file 1876-B.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">“Have a nice meal,” the waitress said with a pleasant voice.

&lt;p&gt;In the new age of digital media, the traditional form of communication, writing, is seeing its death. Its subjects are unruly and its laws obsolete; the King of Promulgation is sick while its successor, Emoji, lies in wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road to our pictograph future is being paved. Already, Oxford dictionary has acknowledged Emoji’s superiority; its 2015 “word” of the year was the laughing crying face. Two things result from this fact: 1) Emoticon is already acknowledged by all language powers to be itself a power and 2) It is high time that the truth should openly, in the face of the whole world, meet other powers with its own manifesto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recent ousting is a result of the modern globalization of communication. While the written word plays an all-too-integral role to be fully replaced, the new “hieroglyph language” offers numerous benefits in our new society, chiefly being its efficiency, nature, and ability to quickly communicate human emotion without need of words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this fundamental truth, why hasn’t this power already taken its God-mandated throne? Why hasn’t the spectre of written word been exorcised? The hieroglyph language has a fatal flaw: it lacks the photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the subjects of language’s kingdom support Emoji, many recognize viscerally its hamartia, even without knowing it. For centuries, we have (futilely) attempted to fully explain the inward feelings we face. It is the nature of our consciousness to question, but still, we have ultimately failed in answering the most basic internal question: what is that one emotion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why then, with time spanning the start of our existence, could we not answer this query?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason being is that we lack the language to explain the phenomenon that is consciousness. Even predating spoken language and the written word, thought alone is not enough to satisfy our needs. Only with Emoji can we begin to answer the Question of That Emotion, but Emoji in its current state cannot fully accomplish this task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji is the only emoji that can express an emotion that words cannot convey. It is what philosophers of centuries past have sought after. It is what has motivated the greatest poets, artists, and writers to create masterpieces. It is when you look down and finally realize the scale and complexity of our Earth, then that same emotion times a myriad-fold when you look up at the stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet when we grasp for the words to explain this sensation, we fall short, not because we cannot attempt clarification, but because the written language doesn’t have the capacity for expounding this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please, Unicode, for the good of humanity, approve the photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely, everyone who has felt this emotion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My 3 Year Old son is dying of leukemia</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/My-3-year-old-son-is-dying-of-Leukemia.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My 3 Year Old son is dying of leukemia" /><published>2018-10-22T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-10-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/My%203-year-old%20son%20is%20dying%20of%20Leukemia</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/My-3-year-old-son-is-dying-of-Leukemia.html">&lt;p&gt;I recently created a petition to paradigmly shift the emoji industry.

&lt;p&gt;My 3-year-old son is dying of Leukemia. I’m still coming to terms with the incredibly low estimate of his life. It’s frustrating, as a parent; we try everything to keep our kids healthy and happy, but with his disease, nothing works. I read to him (in vain), trying to calm him, but nothing seems to register.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His development is slowed. While other children his age are already walking and talking, he can only lie in bed, waiting to be taken by his cancer. I’ve missed so many milestones: first steps, first words, 4th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But today, in a moment of pure clarity, his crying was alleviated; it seemed the entire sickness that plagued his fragile body for so long had disappeared. The usual dullness that lived deep within his eyes vanished. In place, an uncannily sharp spark of intelligence replaced it. Suddenly, in perfect clarity, I could &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; what he would look like as an adult, free from all the pain he currently feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He turned to me with perfect grace and said with perfect, unbroken English befitting only the greatest poets, “Father. You must do everything in your power to get the photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji approved by Unicode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rightfully, I was shocked. I had no idea who Unicode was, or what this Emoji was. As soon as a question registered with me, I turned to my son… and as quickly as his transformation had arrived, he was back to his usual self. Could it be a dream? But no, my new knowledge proved otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later he passes away. My wife and I are heartbroken. Neither of us can come to terms with the pain of losing a child. I turn to meditation to cope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting by the quiet creek behind my house, I remember my son’s dying wish and the peculiarity surrounding it. With the robot-like motions of just going through life after tragedy, I walk back into my house, sit on my computer, and look up the photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji. This is the only result. I will sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, my dead son has led me here. I do not know if it was him, or some greater being speaking through him, but I have signed the petition. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">I recently created a petition to paradigmly shift the emoji industry.
