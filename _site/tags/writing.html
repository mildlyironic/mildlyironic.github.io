	    <p>For my creative writing class, I had to write the prompt: “Describe a restaurant as seen by a person who is waiting for their blind date. Do not mention the date”. For this assignment, we were supposed to be as descriptive as possible.</p>

<p>The smell greeted me first; an aroma of seared chicken, sauteed vegetables, and fry sauce. Was that cannelloni my experienced sniffer detected? Of course, and served with a side of… tomato bisque… caesar salad…lettuce was recently frozen, not fresh… pasta is gluten free, interesting. I rubbed my temples in the strained effort that was detecting restaurant entrees from three blocks down the street. Would anyone find that impressive? I let myself hope in the spirit of tonight’s special occasion.</p>

<p>Rounding the street corner, I could see the building in all its two-and-a-half-star glory. It was nestled comfortably between an ice cream parlor and a crafts store. Very idyllic, I thought. A lone shopping cart roamed the parking lot, pushed by some unseen force. Its rusted wheels creaked softly with each rotation. Few cars were here on a Wednesday night, and with the cold of winter, the ice cream parlor was empty. My cheeks were already starting to turn red, the winter air freezing my nostrils. I was careful not to slip on the thin coating of ice along the lot, evidence from last week’s rain.</p>

<p>The building’s exterior was covered in brickwork. Some designs appeared to be haphazardly inserted. Lighter patches formed uncut diamonds on the wall. The restaurant itself, however, was an exception. I, having incredible ocularly senses, could distinguish the subtle difference of the brick. Clearly, these were the work of an experienced craftsman. While to the unattuned eye, these were just mere bricks, identical to the ones beside it, I recognized them for their true form. I rubbed my hand across its side. Rough hewn… a limestone based concrete… made in Canada… individual stone mined from a nearby query, hmmm, likely six to eight miles away from assembly… industrial oven baked, yes. The common saying, “the bricks are browner on the other side,” held true for this building. Was that a common saying?</p>

<p>My eyes shifted to further study this masterwork of a creation. Adorned on its front door were a series of stickers from travel websites and their respective ratings. Ratings that seemed much higher than what I last read online. What a quickly improving restaurant! My mood brightened even further, to my delight, as I realized what an incredible experience tonight would be, dining in a four-star restaurant! And I knew I wouldn’t be alone.</p>

<p>It was my own personal Statue of Liberty, I thought, and I an immigrant. I wasn’t sure, however, that the weight I had gained would qualify me as a “huddled mass”. That would certainly be a more welcome insult than others I’ve heard.</p>

<p>My pace quickened with excitement as I entered through the building’s door. This must be what the gates of heaven are like! My own mortal eyes limited my perception of this godly realm, but the details I found were astounding. On the wall, a plaque proudly presented to me the restaurant’s food safety review. Proudly, in the far back of the room and obscured partially by a  curtain: “Okay”, it proclaimed, with a figure of a man slightly smiling below it. But look at his eyes, see the absolute joy in them! He clearly achieved Nirvana while dining here.</p>

<p>Warm light from overhead lamps bathed the room in a pleasant glow. It was eternally dawn in this place of peace. Would I find my own new beginnings here? Cool air met me from above. There, a fan spun lazily. Despite its lack of speed, it threatened to fall down at any moment, it’s creaking growing louder. Using my increased sense of perception and infereing ability, I could tell that this was placed here to remind us of our own mortality, as we would soon forget it after dining. Haha, clever me, once again.</p>

<p>Maybe I should touch, I thought. Just to see what it feels like?</p>

<p>“Sir,” a small part of me heard, the noise from the hostess. She, like the restaurant waiting room, smelled like cigarettes. “Sir? Pssst, Mark, come look at this guy. Do you think he’s alright? He’s got this weird, faraway look in his eyes. And look how close he is to the fan blades! Maybe we should call the —”</p>

<p>“I am delightful!” I boomed out, letting the entire restaurant, the whole world know of my status. Several heads turned towards me. All six patrons in the building, surrounded on each side by an ocean of empty chairs and tables, looked at me. I squinted at the hostess’s name tag. “Susan,” I added.</p>

<p>“Err, right,” the hostess, Susan, replied. She gripped something in her purse tighter. “Table for one th—”</p>

<p>“Has anyone else checked in here before me, under my reservation?” I interrupted her once again with my query of utmost importance. “I am quite popular, I will add.”</p>

<p>“Sir, this is is an—” The falling, then shattering, of plates and a curse momentarily silenced her. “We don’t do reservations here.” She gestured towards the myriad of empty tables.</p>

<p>“Well, of course you do, who else did I pay my $50 to, if not to this fine establishment?” I asked. The hostess looked even more disoriented. Her knuckles turned whiter, her hand tightening around something unseen to me in her purse. Working in such a place as this must be so confusing, to be in constant euphoria for hours on end. I gained enough composure for both of us. “Table for two, then, please.”</p>

<p>“Of - of course,” Susan replied. She eyed the waiter behind her, uncertain. Then, she stood up, moved some cylindrical object from her purse to her pocket, and led me towards the back. I caught a quick glimpse of the object’s label: Extra Strength Pepper Spray.</p>

<p>Moving through the restaurant, I thought of maps from the Old World. The way cartographers could misinterpret the continents into rounded, blobby masses of land. Many times, completely omitting certain parts of the world. This was similar to the restaurant, I thought. In our own mortal interpretation of the divine, we associate it with pearly whites, and unbelievable light. Clouds come to mind. But here, was the truth of it. It was grimy. It had dirt, on the walls. I thought I heard scuttering. But these were all just things misaligned from their true meaning. In these perfect proportions, in these perfect settings, these mis-fit characteristics formed the total bliss I saw here.</p>

<p>“Here we are, then,” Susan halted, I was caught off guard by our sudden stop. My table was positioned directly in front of the bathroom. The booth was fixed on the ground, same as the table. Loose stuffing exited the cushions, spilling out onto the floor. The silverware was fixed onto the table like pens at the bank; a thin coord ensured that no patrons took a souvenir home with them. Well, there went a part of my plans for the night. I wondered if I could ask the chef for a fork. I’d settle for a soup spoon, even.</p>

<p>“Uh, thank you,” I said. I eyed the other tables around me. Many were in a similar predicament, with cushions teared, and silverware fixed. But none of the empty tables, truly an ocean of them, were near the bathroom. And none had only a seat for just one. “I need another spot. A table for two, yeah?”</p>

<p>Susan looked looked around at the lack of patrons and abundance of seats. “Sorry,” she said, drawing out the word, “but we have so many reservations, it’s very busy. All of those tables will soon be occupied.”</p>

<p>“Righ, so then you do have reservations here,” I asked. Susan looked behind her.</p>

<p>“Erm… Yes.” She placed a menu on the table and bolted away. The service here was questionable, but fair, I thought. I moved to pull the seat away from the table, but forgot it was fixed in place. I awkwardly shuffled myself into place, and began to study the menu.</p>

<p>What to choose, what to choose? Should I pick something big, to share, or get my own meal? I settled on the latter, and began looking at the entrees. The menu was a laminated sheet of paper, full portions on the front, and the kid’s menu on the back. Both seemed equally ripe with options to pick from.</p>

<p>Illustrations of famous locations in America covered both sides. The Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore, El Capitan. On the back side were a series of tic-tac-toe games, mazes, and coloring pictures. If anyone were below the age of obtaining sentience, it might’ve been fun. I could see trace remains of previous drawings on the back. The menu, being laminated and reusable, didn’t take these coloring attempts well.</p>

<p>When the waiter came over to make my order, I couldn’t pick just one. All of these meals deserved to be sampled multiple times, but I would have to abandon this duty for another time. Another time. My heart started beating faster just thinking of it. I settled on an appetizer to tide me over until later tonight. I eyed the clock in the back of the room.</p>

<p>9:23… 9:23! I realized. That means that I was here for eighty-some minutes! That couldn’t be right. I didn’t notice the other patrons leave beneath the blanket of my inattentiveness. But with my heightened ocular senses and perceptiveness, I knew that to be wrong. “Waiter?” I called. “Waiter!” My voice betrayed me, letting out a sense of worry and urgency I didn’t know that I had. My server turned back towards me.</p>

<p>“I think your clock is broken. It says its past nine, but that of course, is wrong.” He held out his watch to me to show me the time. The same, dreaded time. Stay calm, I told myself, I’ll just check my phone, too— 9:24! I was waiting for that long! I waved the waiter away with a flash of my hand, and moved to the window. I looked outside. Had there been a car accident? A snow storm? The parking lot greeted me, identical to how it looked before.</p>

<p>Well, no, not identical. It was dirty, incredibly so. Were those leaves I saw? In a parking lot! And over there, a shopping cart full of trash. A single receipt, one receipt too many, filled it.</p>

<p>I hadn’t noticed anything wrong before in the building, but now everything was apparent to me. I was Dorothy, taking off my emerald-covered glasses for the first time. The paper-thin guise of heaven, bliss, Nirvana, everything I saw it to be before fell around me. The only catalyst needed was a lack of hope. Truly, this building was the lowest level of Dante’s inferno. What did I do to ever deserve this? I became acutely aware of a baby crying somewhere. Or was that the fan? I settled on the baby cry, it had to be.</p>

<p>I turned my head to the other diners. How could they be so blind to the horrors all around them! No, don’t eat that! I wanted to cry out to the one nearest to me. But my lips wouldn’t obey. He put a forkful of cannelloni in his mouth. While I couldn’t see anything wrong with it, I knew there had to be something horrible lurking below all that cheese.</p>

<p>I starting breathing hard, faster. My doctor wouldn’t be pleased to see me now. I grabbed my heart. I felt the vibrations of a highway.</p>

<p>“Hello?” A voice beckoned me back to reality, but I did not want to return. I had to get out. Was there no oxygen here? I stumbled onto a nearby table. It was unmoved by my fall. The  tables here in heaven are so strong that— I stopped myself. I was done making excuses for this place.</p>

<p>I did my best to shout for help, but my words were muddled by my terror. A scream was the best I managed. I needed to get out, now. I struggled to move my arms. I wanted to do so, but I just couldn’t. I was seeing everything in slow motion, and my body would not cooperate.</p>

<p>I looked down at the table and willed my arms to move to the base. I instantly regretted wrapping my hands around it. My fingers brushed against a layer of dust and food residue. But this wouldn’t be enough to stop my willpower. I started to lift, using all of my strength to pull the table free from the ground. Aided by adrenaline, I thought it would be easy. But I was wrong, just like I was wrong about tonight.</p>

<p>I could see Susan far away from me. She started to run. Destination: me. Pepper spray status: raised. It seemed as if the air was full of syrup as I began to run the opposite direction, out the door. I lost a significant portion of my head start, but was able to exit in time.</p>

<p>The doorway served as a portal out of my own personal hell, a mall front restaurant adorned with an Applebees logo disappearing behind me as I ran. I saw now the reason for it’s low ratings, ratings that would go even lower once I returned home. If only I had brought my car with me, I could move away faster. I wondered how much it would cost to move to Antarctica. Anything to get as far away from here as possible.</p>

<p>Seeing the worst disappear behind me, I let out a whoop of joy. If I ever returned to this place again, I would do so with a tank of kerosene and a lighter. While I doubt the motley bricks would burn, the fire would do good for the building’s interior. I pumped my fist in the air with glee. I had escaped! My incredible, heightened physique carried me through the parking lot. I was a survivor, a — I slipped, fast and hard, on the parking lot ice.</p>

<p>It was fate that angled my face towards the building on last time. Somewhere, there was some divine being laughing at me. I could see the building in all its two-and-a-half star lowliness. Warm light pooled through the windows, threatening to corrupt even more of the world than the restaurant’s interior. The street-side windows offered a modest view of the outside parking lot and highway. The sign above, Applebees, brazenly invited the world to eat. It was a pale yellow accented by red. Of course, the only thing not in a total state of disrepair was the sign.</p>

<p>I remembered the door itself creaking as I exited. It’s glass could easily be mistaken for the tan-colored brick on the side, being so dirty. I saw a smudge, it was there! And that smell, too, that awful smell. It was of fry-sauce and grease, of pestilence and rot. I couldn’t imagine what it would be like during the heat of the summer. I pitied the man eating pasta inside.</p>

<p>When I finally regained the strength to right myself up, I resumed running. I vowed to never go here again. Through the haze of what felt like years, I could still remember enjoying myself at first. How wrong I was.</p>

	    <p>“Have a nice meal,” the waitress said with a pleasant voice. I eyed my meal hungrily. A grand turkey avocado sandwich awaited me.</p>

<p>“Thanks, you too-“ I muttered, then grabbed my mouth. The restaurant immediately quieted as I realized my mistake. But it was too late. The words that would prove my social undoing were already uttered. I grasped for air desperately, trying to recover from my disastrous failure. To all the restaurant’s inhabitants — made by fate spectators to my misfortune — it might’ve looked like I was trying to inhale my sent out words, to take them back somehow. Oh, how I wish I could!</p>

<p>The waitress to whom I directed my mispeech towards immediately turned to vomit. Her disgust was made palpable in the hurled up spaghetti on floor; at least, what once was spaghetti. Other patrons had similar reactions. I knew that I had sacrificed my right to blame them when I had made my error.</p>

<p>Eternally, I will remember the moment, the source of my terrible insomnia today. It took twelve psychologists, two firemen, and the Air-Force’s best men to undo the actions of that night. Everything except for the terrible emotional scars disappeared under government classified file 1876-B.</p>

	    <p>I recently created a petition to paradigmly shift the emoji industry. The following is a comment left on the petition, possibly by someone other than myself.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/unicode-have-unicode-adopt-the-photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning-emoji" title="Change.org Petition Link"><img src="../img/Petition.png" alt="Change.org Petition" class="img" /></a></p>

<p>My 3-year-old son is dying of Leukemia. I’m still coming to terms with the incredibly low estimate of his life. It’s frustrating, as a parent; we try everything to keep our kids healthy and happy, but with his disease, nothing works. I read to him (in vain), trying to calm him, but nothing seems to register.</p>

<p>His development is slowed. While other children his age are already walking and talking, he can only lie in bed, waiting to be taken by his cancer. I’ve missed so many milestones: first steps, first words, 4th birthday.</p>

<p>But today, in a moment of pure clarity, his crying was alleviated; it seemed the entire sickness that plagued his fragile body for so long had disappeared. The usual dullness that lived deep within his eyes vanished. In place, an uncannily sharp spark of intelligence replaced it. Suddenly, in perfect clarity, I could <em>see</em> what he would look like as an adult, free from all the pain he currently feels.</p>

<p>He turned to me with perfect grace and said with perfect, unbroken English befitting only the greatest poets, “Father. You must do everything in your power to get the photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji approved by Unicode.</p>

<p>Rightfully, I was shocked. I had no idea who Unicode was, or what this Emoji was. As soon as a question registered with me, I turned to my son… and as quickly as his transformation had arrived, he was back to his usual self. Could it be a dream? But no, my new knowledge proved otherwise.</p>

<p>Two weeks later he passes away. My wife and I are heartbroken. Neither of us can come to terms with the pain of losing a child. I turn to meditation to cope.</p>

<p>Sitting by the quiet creek behind my house, I remember my son’s dying wish and the peculiarity surrounding it. With the robot-like motions of just going through life after tragedy, I walk back into my house, sit on my computer, and look up the photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji. This is the only result. I will sign.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, my dead son has led me here. I do not know if it was him, or some greater being speaking through him, but I have signed the petition. Thank you.</p>

<p>In the new age of digital media, the traditional form of communication, writing, is seeing its death. Its subjects are unruly and its laws obsolete; the King of Promulgation is sick while its successor, Emoji, lies in wait.</p>

<p>The road to our pictograph future is being paved. Already, Oxford dictionary has acknowledged Emoji’s superiority; its 2015 “word” of the year was the laughing crying face. Two things result from this fact: 1) Emoticon is already acknowledged by all language powers to be itself a power and 2) It is high time that the truth should openly, in the face of the whole world, meet other powers with its own manifesto.</p>

<p>This recent ousting is a result of the modern globalization of communication. While the written word plays an all-too-integral role to be fully replaced, the new “hieroglyph language” offers numerous benefits in our new society, chiefly being its efficiency, nature, and ability to quickly communicate human emotion without need of words.</p>

<p>With this fundamental truth, why hasn’t this power already taken its God-mandated throne? Why hasn’t the spectre of written word been exorcised? The hieroglyph language has a fatal flaw: it lacks the photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji.</p>

<p>While the subjects of language’s kingdom support Emoji, many recognize viscerally its hamartia, even without knowing it. For centuries, we have (futilely) attempted to fully explain the inward feelings we face. It is the nature of our consciousness to question, but still, we have ultimately failed in answering the most basic internal question: what is that one emotion?</p>

<p>So why then, with time spanning the start of our existence, could we not answer this query?</p>

<p>The reason being is that we lack the language to explain the phenomenon that is consciousness. Even predating spoken language and the written word, thought alone is not enough to satisfy our needs. Only with Emoji can we begin to answer the Question of That Emotion, but Emoji in its current state cannot fully accomplish this task.</p>

<p>The photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji is the only emoji that can express an emotion that words cannot convey. It is what philosophers of centuries past have sought after. It is what has motivated the greatest poets, artists, and writers to create masterpieces. It is when you look down and finally realize the scale and complexity of our Earth, then that same emotion times a myriad-fold when you look up at the stars.</p>

<p>And yet when we grasp for the words to explain this sensation, we fall short, not because we cannot attempt clarification, but because the written language doesn’t have the capacity for expounding this.</p>

<p>So please, Unicode, for the good of humanity, approve the photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji.</p>

<p>Sincerely, everyone who has felt this emotion.</p>

	    <p>The gardener’s yard seemed to pull off a harmony only the most practiced orchestra could muster; in the back, a group of daffodils, trumpets with their beautiful bronze yellows. The clarinet section would be the lovely blue bells in the shade of the old willow. The lavender, perfectly emulating quiet flutes. And the rising crescendo of roses that seemed absolutely befitting to bask in the sun where everyone could see them.</p>

<p>The yard was often the talk of quiet envy among the neighbors. Surely these colors could only be the result of some form of trickery. Some new sprinklers? Special lights? GMO’s? Passer-bys would argue about the method of care with great thought. It was hard not to, as the lawn never seemed to require tending. The gardener, it appeared, would never leave his house to look after the plants. It had to be sometime in the night’s embrace. One individual had even ran up to the roses to feel them, certainly expecting the texture of plastic under their fingers. Only assurance that the flowers were indeed very real — and with thorns — awaited them. That, and the stern eye of the gardener from his window.</p>

<p>The plant-enthusiast was a man in his late fifties, new to the neighborhood. He rarely went out, only in strange hours, and kept to himself. It seemed he wasn’t concerned with building any relationships with his fellows.</p>

<p>Of course, this led the neighbors to gossip. The only thing they really knew was that he invited quite a few people, usually one at a time, to his house. Not regularly, but he did have guests. No one would really return again to the place. Was he that repulsive as to drive them away? It seemed the gardener was very lonely. The few that understood knew the truth, or at least part of it: the man’s wife had disappeared soon after moving in. Rumors told of a scandal, then her moving very far away.</p>

<p>After the incident, the man turned gardener. First, a pad of daisies, white like an old woman’s hair. Weeks later, bluebells of a soft azure, almost matching a familiar eye color. The garden resembled a person in some ways, but not bound only by one individual. A row of daffodils like a youth’s hair. Carnations in every shade of skin. The lawn grew slowly, new additions being added irregularly.</p>

<p>No one ever learned the secret of the gardener’s yard. Most accepted the unnaturally vibrant colors as some form of luck. In a way, it was fate’s forgiveness to a lonely man who had lost his wife. Whatever the method, the HOA was certainly pleased with how nice it made the neighborhood look.</p>

	    <p>For my creative writing class, I had to write the prompt: “Describe a restaurant as seen by a person who is waiting for their blind date. Do not mention the date”. For this assignment, we were supposed to be as descriptive as possible.</p>

<p>The smell greeted me first; an aroma of seared chicken, sauteed vegetables, and fry sauce. Was that cannelloni my experienced sniffer detected? Of course, and served with a side of… tomato bisque… caesar salad…lettuce was recently frozen, not fresh… pasta is gluten free, interesting. I rubbed my temples in the strained effort that was detecting restaurant entrees from three blocks down the street. Would anyone find that impressive? I let myself hope in the spirit of tonight’s special occasion.</p>

<p>Rounding the street corner, I could see the building in all its two-and-a-half-star glory. It was nestled comfortably between an ice cream parlor and a crafts store. Very idyllic, I thought. A lone shopping cart roamed the parking lot, pushed by some unseen force. Its rusted wheels creaked softly with each rotation. Few cars were here on a Wednesday night, and with the cold of winter, the ice cream parlor was empty. My cheeks were already starting to turn red, the winter air freezing my nostrils. I was careful not to slip on the thin coating of ice along the lot, evidence from last week’s rain.</p>

<p>The building’s exterior was covered in brickwork. Some designs appeared to be haphazardly inserted. Lighter patches formed uncut diamonds on the wall. The restaurant itself, however, was an exception. I, having incredible ocularly senses, could distinguish the subtle difference of the brick. Clearly, these were the work of an experienced craftsman. While to the unattuned eye, these were just mere bricks, identical to the ones beside it, I recognized them for their true form. I rubbed my hand across its side. Rough hewn… a limestone based concrete… made in Canada… individual stone mined from a nearby query, hmmm, likely six to eight miles away from assembly… industrial oven baked, yes. The common saying, “the bricks are browner on the other side,” held true for this building. Was that a common saying?</p>

<p>My eyes shifted to further study this masterwork of a creation. Adorned on its front door were a series of stickers from travel websites and their respective ratings. Ratings that seemed much higher than what I last read online. What a quickly improving restaurant! My mood brightened even further, to my delight, as I realized what an incredible experience tonight would be, dining in a four-star restaurant! And I knew I wouldn’t be alone.</p>

<p>It was my own personal Statue of Liberty, I thought, and I an immigrant. I wasn’t sure, however, that the weight I had gained would qualify me as a “huddled mass”. That would certainly be a more welcome insult than others I’ve heard.</p>

<p>My pace quickened with excitement as I entered through the building’s door. This must be what the gates of heaven are like! My own mortal eyes limited my perception of this godly realm, but the details I found were astounding. On the wall, a plaque proudly presented to me the restaurant’s food safety review. Proudly, in the far back of the room and obscured partially by a  curtain: “Okay”, it proclaimed, with a figure of a man slightly smiling below it. But look at his eyes, see the absolute joy in them! He clearly achieved Nirvana while dining here.</p>

<p>Warm light from overhead lamps bathed the room in a pleasant glow. It was eternally dawn in this place of peace. Would I find my own new beginnings here? Cool air met me from above. There, a fan spun lazily. Despite its lack of speed, it threatened to fall down at any moment, it’s creaking growing louder. Using my increased sense of perception and infereing ability, I could tell that this was placed here to remind us of our own mortality, as we would soon forget it after dining. Haha, clever me, once again.</p>

<p>Maybe I should touch, I thought. Just to see what it feels like?</p>

<p>“Sir,” a small part of me heard, the noise from the hostess. She, like the restaurant waiting room, smelled like cigarettes. “Sir? Pssst, Mark, come look at this guy. Do you think he’s alright? He’s got this weird, faraway look in his eyes. And look how close he is to the fan blades! Maybe we should call the —”</p>

<p>“I am delightful!” I boomed out, letting the entire restaurant, the whole world know of my status. Several heads turned towards me. All six patrons in the building, surrounded on each side by an ocean of empty chairs and tables, looked at me. I squinted at the hostess’s name tag. “Susan,” I added.</p>

<p>“Err, right,” the hostess, Susan, replied. She gripped something in her purse tighter. “Table for one th—”</p>

<p>“Has anyone else checked in here before me, under my reservation?” I interrupted her once again with my query of utmost importance. “I am quite popular, I will add.”</p>

<p>“Sir, this is is an—” The falling, then shattering, of plates and a curse momentarily silenced her. “We don’t do reservations here.” She gestured towards the myriad of empty tables.</p>

<p>“Well, of course you do, who else did I pay my $50 to, if not to this fine establishment?” I asked. The hostess looked even more disoriented. Her knuckles turned whiter, her hand tightening around something unseen to me in her purse. Working in such a place as this must be so confusing, to be in constant euphoria for hours on end. I gained enough composure for both of us. “Table for two, then, please.”</p>

<p>“Of - of course,” Susan replied. She eyed the waiter behind her, uncertain. Then, she stood up, moved some cylindrical object from her purse to her pocket, and led me towards the back. I caught a quick glimpse of the object’s label: Extra Strength Pepper Spray.</p>

<p>Moving through the restaurant, I thought of maps from the Old World. The way cartographers could misinterpret the continents into rounded, blobby masses of land. Many times, completely omitting certain parts of the world. This was similar to the restaurant, I thought. In our own mortal interpretation of the divine, we associate it with pearly whites, and unbelievable light. Clouds come to mind. But here, was the truth of it. It was grimy. It had dirt, on the walls. I thought I heard scuttering. But these were all just things misaligned from their true meaning. In these perfect proportions, in these perfect settings, these mis-fit characteristics formed the total bliss I saw here.</p>

<p>“Here we are, then,” Susan halted, I was caught off guard by our sudden stop. My table was positioned directly in front of the bathroom. The booth was fixed on the ground, same as the table. Loose stuffing exited the cushions, spilling out onto the floor. The silverware was fixed onto the table like pens at the bank; a thin coord ensured that no patrons took a souvenir home with them. Well, there went a part of my plans for the night. I wondered if I could ask the chef for a fork. I’d settle for a soup spoon, even.</p>

<p>“Uh, thank you,” I said. I eyed the other tables around me. Many were in a similar predicament, with cushions teared, and silverware fixed. But none of the empty tables, truly an ocean of them, were near the bathroom. And none had only a seat for just one. “I need another spot. A table for two, yeah?”</p>

<p>Susan looked looked around at the lack of patrons and abundance of seats. “Sorry,” she said, drawing out the word, “but we have so many reservations, it’s very busy. All of those tables will soon be occupied.”</p>

<p>“Righ, so then you do have reservations here,” I asked. Susan looked behind her.</p>

<p>“Erm… Yes.” She placed a menu on the table and bolted away. The service here was questionable, but fair, I thought. I moved to pull the seat away from the table, but forgot it was fixed in place. I awkwardly shuffled myself into place, and began to study the menu.</p>

<p>What to choose, what to choose? Should I pick something big, to share, or get my own meal? I settled on the latter, and began looking at the entrees. The menu was a laminated sheet of paper, full portions on the front, and the kid’s menu on the back. Both seemed equally ripe with options to pick from.</p>

<p>Illustrations of famous locations in America covered both sides. The Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore, El Capitan. On the back side were a series of tic-tac-toe games, mazes, and coloring pictures. If anyone were below the age of obtaining sentience, it might’ve been fun. I could see trace remains of previous drawings on the back. The menu, being laminated and reusable, didn’t take these coloring attempts well.</p>

<p>When the waiter came over to make my order, I couldn’t pick just one. All of these meals deserved to be sampled multiple times, but I would have to abandon this duty for another time. Another time. My heart started beating faster just thinking of it. I settled on an appetizer to tide me over until later tonight. I eyed the clock in the back of the room.</p>

<p>9:23… 9:23! I realized. That means that I was here for eighty-some minutes! That couldn’t be right. I didn’t notice the other patrons leave beneath the blanket of my inattentiveness. But with my heightened ocular senses and perceptiveness, I knew that to be wrong. “Waiter?” I called. “Waiter!” My voice betrayed me, letting out a sense of worry and urgency I didn’t know that I had. My server turned back towards me.</p>

<p>“I think your clock is broken. It says its past nine, but that of course, is wrong.” He held out his watch to me to show me the time. The same, dreaded time. Stay calm, I told myself, I’ll just check my phone, too— 9:24! I was waiting for that long! I waved the waiter away with a flash of my hand, and moved to the window. I looked outside. Had there been a car accident? A snow storm? The parking lot greeted me, identical to how it looked before.</p>

<p>Well, no, not identical. It was dirty, incredibly so. Were those leaves I saw? In a parking lot! And over there, a shopping cart full of trash. A single receipt, one receipt too many, filled it.</p>

<p>I hadn’t noticed anything wrong before in the building, but now everything was apparent to me. I was Dorothy, taking off my emerald-covered glasses for the first time. The paper-thin guise of heaven, bliss, Nirvana, everything I saw it to be before fell around me. The only catalyst needed was a lack of hope. Truly, this building was the lowest level of Dante’s inferno. What did I do to ever deserve this? I became acutely aware of a baby crying somewhere. Or was that the fan? I settled on the baby cry, it had to be.</p>

<p>I turned my head to the other diners. How could they be so blind to the horrors all around them! No, don’t eat that! I wanted to cry out to the one nearest to me. But my lips wouldn’t obey. He put a forkful of cannelloni in his mouth. While I couldn’t see anything wrong with it, I knew there had to be something horrible lurking below all that cheese.</p>

<p>I starting breathing hard, faster. My doctor wouldn’t be pleased to see me now. I grabbed my heart. I felt the vibrations of a highway.</p>

<p>“Hello?” A voice beckoned me back to reality, but I did not want to return. I had to get out. Was there no oxygen here? I stumbled onto a nearby table. It was unmoved by my fall. The  tables here in heaven are so strong that— I stopped myself. I was done making excuses for this place.</p>

<p>I did my best to shout for help, but my words were muddled by my terror. A scream was the best I managed. I needed to get out, now. I struggled to move my arms. I wanted to do so, but I just couldn’t. I was seeing everything in slow motion, and my body would not cooperate.</p>

<p>I looked down at the table and willed my arms to move to the base. I instantly regretted wrapping my hands around it. My fingers brushed against a layer of dust and food residue. But this wouldn’t be enough to stop my willpower. I started to lift, using all of my strength to pull the table free from the ground. Aided by adrenaline, I thought it would be easy. But I was wrong, just like I was wrong about tonight.</p>

<p>I could see Susan far away from me. She started to run. Destination: me. Pepper spray status: raised. It seemed as if the air was full of syrup as I began to run the opposite direction, out the door. I lost a significant portion of my head start, but was able to exit in time.</p>

<p>The doorway served as a portal out of my own personal hell, a mall front restaurant adorned with an Applebees logo disappearing behind me as I ran. I saw now the reason for it’s low ratings, ratings that would go even lower once I returned home. If only I had brought my car with me, I could move away faster. I wondered how much it would cost to move to Antarctica. Anything to get as far away from here as possible.</p>

<p>Seeing the worst disappear behind me, I let out a whoop of joy. If I ever returned to this place again, I would do so with a tank of kerosene and a lighter. While I doubt the motley bricks would burn, the fire would do good for the building’s interior. I pumped my fist in the air with glee. I had escaped! My incredible, heightened physique carried me through the parking lot. I was a survivor, a — I slipped, fast and hard, on the parking lot ice.</p>

<p>It was fate that angled my face towards the building on last time. Somewhere, there was some divine being laughing at me. I could see the building in all its two-and-a-half star lowliness. Warm light pooled through the windows, threatening to corrupt even more of the world than the restaurant’s interior. The street-side windows offered a modest view of the outside parking lot and highway. The sign above, Applebees, brazenly invited the world to eat. It was a pale yellow accented by red. Of course, the only thing not in a total state of disrepair was the sign.</p>

<p>I remembered the door itself creaking as I exited. It’s glass could easily be mistaken for the tan-colored brick on the side, being so dirty. I saw a smudge, it was there! And that smell, too, that awful smell. It was of fry-sauce and grease, of pestilence and rot. I couldn’t imagine what it would be like during the heat of the summer. I pitied the man eating pasta inside.</p>

<p>When I finally regained the strength to right myself up, I resumed running. I vowed to never go here again. Through the haze of what felt like years, I could still remember enjoying myself at first. How wrong I was.</p>

	    <p>“Have a nice meal,” the waitress said with a pleasant voice. I eyed my meal hungrily. A grand turkey avocado sandwich awaited me.</p>

<p>“Thanks, you too-“ I muttered, then grabbed my mouth. The restaurant immediately quieted as I realized my mistake. But it was too late. The words that would prove my social undoing were already uttered. I grasped for air desperately, trying to recover from my disastrous failure. To all the restaurant’s inhabitants — made by fate spectators to my misfortune — it might’ve looked like I was trying to inhale my sent out words, to take them back somehow. Oh, how I wish I could!</p>

<p>The waitress to whom I directed my mispeech towards immediately turned to vomit. Her disgust was made palpable in the hurled up spaghetti on floor; at least, what once was spaghetti. Other patrons had similar reactions. I knew that I had sacrificed my right to blame them when I had made my error.</p>

<p>Eternally, I will remember the moment, the source of my terrible insomnia today. It took twelve psychologists, two firemen, and the Air-Force’s best men to undo the actions of that night. Everything except for the terrible emotional scars disappeared under government classified file 1876-B.</p>

	    <p>I recently created a petition to paradigmly shift the emoji industry. The following is a comment left on the petition, possibly by someone other than myself.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/unicode-have-unicode-adopt-the-photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning-emoji" title="Change.org Petition Link"><img src="../img/Petition.png" alt="Change.org Petition" class="img" /></a></p>

<p>My 3-year-old son is dying of Leukemia. I’m still coming to terms with the incredibly low estimate of his life. It’s frustrating, as a parent; we try everything to keep our kids healthy and happy, but with his disease, nothing works. I read to him (in vain), trying to calm him, but nothing seems to register.</p>

<p>His development is slowed. While other children his age are already walking and talking, he can only lie in bed, waiting to be taken by his cancer. I’ve missed so many milestones: first steps, first words, 4th birthday.</p>

<p>But today, in a moment of pure clarity, his crying was alleviated; it seemed the entire sickness that plagued his fragile body for so long had disappeared. The usual dullness that lived deep within his eyes vanished. In place, an uncannily sharp spark of intelligence replaced it. Suddenly, in perfect clarity, I could <em>see</em> what he would look like as an adult, free from all the pain he currently feels.</p>

<p>He turned to me with perfect grace and said with perfect, unbroken English befitting only the greatest poets, “Father. You must do everything in your power to get the photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji approved by Unicode.</p>

<p>Rightfully, I was shocked. I had no idea who Unicode was, or what this Emoji was. As soon as a question registered with me, I turned to my son… and as quickly as his transformation had arrived, he was back to his usual self. Could it be a dream? But no, my new knowledge proved otherwise.</p>

<p>Two weeks later he passes away. My wife and I are heartbroken. Neither of us can come to terms with the pain of losing a child. I turn to meditation to cope.</p>

<p>Sitting by the quiet creek behind my house, I remember my son’s dying wish and the peculiarity surrounding it. With the robot-like motions of just going through life after tragedy, I walk back into my house, sit on my computer, and look up the photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji. This is the only result. I will sign.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, my dead son has led me here. I do not know if it was him, or some greater being speaking through him, but I have signed the petition. Thank you.</p>

<p>In the new age of digital media, the traditional form of communication, writing, is seeing its death. Its subjects are unruly and its laws obsolete; the King of Promulgation is sick while its successor, Emoji, lies in wait.</p>

<p>The road to our pictograph future is being paved. Already, Oxford dictionary has acknowledged Emoji’s superiority; its 2015 “word” of the year was the laughing crying face. Two things result from this fact: 1) Emoticon is already acknowledged by all language powers to be itself a power and 2) It is high time that the truth should openly, in the face of the whole world, meet other powers with its own manifesto.</p>

<p>This recent ousting is a result of the modern globalization of communication. While the written word plays an all-too-integral role to be fully replaced, the new “hieroglyph language” offers numerous benefits in our new society, chiefly being its efficiency, nature, and ability to quickly communicate human emotion without need of words.</p>

<p>With this fundamental truth, why hasn’t this power already taken its God-mandated throne? Why hasn’t the spectre of written word been exorcised? The hieroglyph language has a fatal flaw: it lacks the photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji.</p>

<p>While the subjects of language’s kingdom support Emoji, many recognize viscerally its hamartia, even without knowing it. For centuries, we have (futilely) attempted to fully explain the inward feelings we face. It is the nature of our consciousness to question, but still, we have ultimately failed in answering the most basic internal question: what is that one emotion?</p>

<p>So why then, with time spanning the start of our existence, could we not answer this query?</p>

<p>The reason being is that we lack the language to explain the phenomenon that is consciousness. Even predating spoken language and the written word, thought alone is not enough to satisfy our needs. Only with Emoji can we begin to answer the Question of That Emotion, but Emoji in its current state cannot fully accomplish this task.</p>

<p>The photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji is the only emoji that can express an emotion that words cannot convey. It is what philosophers of centuries past have sought after. It is what has motivated the greatest poets, artists, and writers to create masterpieces. It is when you look down and finally realize the scale and complexity of our Earth, then that same emotion times a myriad-fold when you look up at the stars.</p>

<p>And yet when we grasp for the words to explain this sensation, we fall short, not because we cannot attempt clarification, but because the written language doesn’t have the capacity for expounding this.</p>

<p>So please, Unicode, for the good of humanity, approve the photorealistic-thinking-crying-grinning emoji.</p>

<p>Sincerely, everyone who has felt this emotion.</p>

	    <p>The gardener’s yard seemed to pull off a harmony only the most practiced orchestra could muster; in the back, a group of daffodils, trumpets with their beautiful bronze yellows. The clarinet section would be the lovely blue bells in the shade of the old willow. The lavender, perfectly emulating quiet flutes. And the rising crescendo of roses that seemed absolutely befitting to bask in the sun where everyone could see them.</p>

<p>The yard was often the talk of quiet envy among the neighbors. Surely these colors could only be the result of some form of trickery. Some new sprinklers? Special lights? GMO’s? Passer-bys would argue about the method of care with great thought. It was hard not to, as the lawn never seemed to require tending. The gardener, it appeared, would never leave his house to look after the plants. It had to be sometime in the night’s embrace. One individual had even ran up to the roses to feel them, certainly expecting the texture of plastic under their fingers. Only assurance that the flowers were indeed very real — and with thorns — awaited them. That, and the stern eye of the gardener from his window.</p>

<p>The plant-enthusiast was a man in his late fifties, new to the neighborhood. He rarely went out, only in strange hours, and kept to himself. It seemed he wasn’t concerned with building any relationships with his fellows.</p>

<p>Of course, this led the neighbors to gossip. The only thing they really knew was that he invited quite a few people, usually one at a time, to his house. Not regularly, but he did have guests. No one would really return again to the place. Was he that repulsive as to drive them away? It seemed the gardener was very lonely. The few that understood knew the truth, or at least part of it: the man’s wife had disappeared soon after moving in. Rumors told of a scandal, then her moving very far away.</p>

<p>After the incident, the man turned gardener. First, a pad of daisies, white like an old woman’s hair. Weeks later, bluebells of a soft azure, almost matching a familiar eye color. The garden resembled a person in some ways, but not bound only by one individual. A row of daffodils like a youth’s hair. Carnations in every shade of skin. The lawn grew slowly, new additions being added irregularly.</p>

<p>No one ever learned the secret of the gardener’s yard. Most accepted the unnaturally vibrant colors as some form of luck. In a way, it was fate’s forgiveness to a lonely man who had lost his wife. Whatever the method, the HOA was certainly pleased with how nice it made the neighborhood look.</p>
